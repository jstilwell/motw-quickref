                                    <p>
                                        Eliza, half Native American, was born in a desert somewhere in North Americass
                                        and was abandoned shortly
                                        thereafter.
                                        Her biological mother was white and her father was Navajo and Eliza was the
                                        result of a
                                        one
                                        night stand. She was discovered and adopted by a loving white family, and then
                                        brought up in nice home, but taught her parents' religion while being forbidden
                                        to seek more knowledge about her ancestors' religion. Her father was a strict
                                        religious leader
                                        in town.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        She had a mostly uneventful childhood. She was taught to hunt and handle
                                        guns by
                                        her
                                        father. She did well in school and played basketball for the middle school
                                        and
                                        high
                                        school teams. She showed aptitude for math early on. It eventually led to
                                        her
                                        moving to the East coast attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Having never had alcohol or drugs, she was talked into taking magic
                                        mushrooms in
                                        her
                                        freshman year. During her first experience, Eliza believes that she was
                                        recruited
                                        and trained by a race of aliens tasked with protecting the earth from
                                        supernatural
                                        interdemensional monsters. She left the trip convinced that the aliens were
                                        gods
                                        from Native American lore that had chosen her because of her heritage and
                                        unique
                                        skills with computers.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Well on her way to becoming a professional programmer, she found the
                                        hallucinagenic
                                        experience overwhelming and dropped out of college soon after. She looked
                                        for
                                        any
                                        and all hallucinagens to try to talk to the aliens again, but she could
                                        never
                                        make
                                        contact with them again.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In the meantime, she took the task seriously and
                                        Eliza
                                        dedicated all of her time to studying the supernatural and the occult. She
                                        dropped out of college and moved
                                        back to the desert where she could feel more closely connected to her ancestral
                                        roots. She
                                        used
                                        her
                                        computer skills to create a database where she kept all of her findings --
                                        the
                                        first
                                        of its kind in digital form.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Now an old woman, Eliza continues to study, hunt, and build upon her
                                        database.
                                        She is a legend in
                                        the
                                        crypto zoological
                                        scene, but most view her as a whackjob due to her alien stories and
                                        proclivity
                                        for being high on hallucinagens for days at a time. Regardless, she
                                        is the first call for many hunters in North America when they need advice.
