                                    <p>
                                        Eliza, half Native American, was born in Arizona and abandoned shortly
                                        thereafter.
                                        Her mother was white and her father was Navajo and Eliza was the result of a one
                                        night stand. She was adopted by a loving white family and then moved to a tiny
                                        coastal town in Massachusetts.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        She had a mostly uneventful childhood. She was taught to hunt and handle guns by
                                        her
                                        father. She did well in school and played basketball for the middle school and
                                        high
                                        school teams. She showed aptitude for math early on. It eventually led to her
                                        attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Having never had alcohol or drugs, she was talked into taking magic mushrooms in
                                        her
                                        freshman year. During her first experience, Eliza believes that she was
                                        recruited
                                        and trained by a race of aliens tasked with protecting the earth from
                                        supernatural
                                        interdemensional monsters.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Well on her way to becoming a professional programmer, she found the
                                        hallucinagenic
                                        experience overwhelming and dropped out of college soon after. She looked for
                                        any
                                        and all hallucinagens to try to talk to the aliens again, but she could never
                                        make
                                        contact with them again.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In the meantime, she took the aliens seriously and when she wasn't tripping,
                                        Eliza
                                        dedicated all of her time to studying the supernatural and the occult. She used
                                        her
                                        computer skills to create a database where she kept all of her findings -- the
                                        first
                                        of its kind in digital form.
