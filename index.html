                                    Whenever you suffer harm, the Keeper
                                    will tell you what effect it has.
                                    Injury severity depends on how much
                                    harm you have suffered:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>0-harm wounds have only minor, short term effects.</li>
                                        <li>4-7 harm wounds are serious and unstable. They will get worse unless
                                            treated. Mark the “Unstable” box.</li>
                                        <li>8-harm or more will kill a normal human, including a hunter.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>

                                    Armour reduces the harm suffered by
